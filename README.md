wakeRes
=======

A status bar app for Mac OS X that allows you to schedule a resolution refresh on system wake.

What is it for?
----------------
This app helps to address the issue that causes "unsupported" AMD GPUs to run slower after your mac wakes up from
sleep. Simply launch it when you log in to your machine, and it will reset your resolution for you everytime your
machine wakes up.

Current Features
----------------
- View current resolution
- Force a resolution refresh
- Set resolution to refresh on system wake.
- Set a delay for the resolution refresh. (Default is 15 seconds)

Future Enhancements
-------------------
- Resolution & refresh rate selection.
- Desktop image scripting (change w/ weather, seasons, etc.)
- Trigger resolution refresh when a user defined app launches (useful for games and other GPU intensive apps).

Note: Application Icons are just placeholders at the moment.

Troubleshooting
---------------
- If your resolution fails to return to normal, log out and back in again. Resolution changes are session scoped.  
- If GPU performance still suffers upon wake, try adjusting the delay to a longer setting.
