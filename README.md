wakeRes
=======

A status bar app for Mac OS X that allows you to schedule a resolution refresh on system wake.

Current Features
----------------
- View current resolution
- Force a resolution refresh
- Set resolution to refresh on system wake.
- Set a delay for the resolution refresh. (Default is 15 seconds)

Future Enhancements
-------------------
- Resolution & refresh rate selection.
- Desktop image scripting (change w/ weather, seasons, etc.)
- Trigger resolution refresh when a user defined app launches.

Note: Application Icons are just placeholders at the moment.

Troubleshooting
---------------
- If your resolution fails to return to normal, log out and back in again. Resolution changes are session scoped.  
- If GPU performance still suffers upon wake, try adjusting the delay to a longer setting.
